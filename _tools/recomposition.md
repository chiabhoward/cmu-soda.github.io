Recomp-Verify is a model checker for the TLA+ formal specification language.
This tool uses a compositional verification technique called *recomposition* to implement model checking.
This technique is described in our FMCAD'24 paper *Recomposition: A New Technique for Efficient Compositional Verification*.
The tool is available [here](https://github.com/cmu-soda/recomp-verify/tree/FMCAD24).
